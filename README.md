## **🎉If I Had More Time**

- Fix spacing - some bullet points and icons are not perfectly aligned as well as the spacing in the Account Modal on mobile.
- Add in skeleton loading for initial render.
- Add in "No search results found" message when filtering returns no results.
- If the app was more robust and needed to be more scalable - use **Atomic Design Principles** for splitting components, with **table cells as the atoms** and moving up from there.
